Assignment Details
------
Write a new network that
- has the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (No MaxPooling, but 3 convolutions, where the last one has a stride of 2 instead) (If you can figure out how to use Dilated kernels        here instead of MP or strided convolution, then 200pts extra!)
- total RF must be more than 44
- one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution
- one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
- use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
- use albumentation library and apply:
    - horizontal flip
    - shiftScaleRotate
    - coarseDropout (max_holes = 1, max_height=16px, max_width=16, min_holes = 1, min_height=16px, min_width=16px, fill_value=(mean of your dataset), mask_fill_value = None)
- achieve 85% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 200k.
